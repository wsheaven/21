# Overview

This is a kotlin program of the common game 21 or blackjack. It is a simple console based game that allows you to play through simple text inputs.  

I recently decided that I wanted to learn kotlin, at the same time some friends of mine hat gotten into playing 21 in their spare time so I decided the best way to combine the two would be to create 21 in kotlin! Because I am already familiar with the game I was able to focus on the syntax of kotlin and becoming more familiar with it.
